Short Description
A student completes a security challenge in Codesafe that demonstrates how SQL injection works and fixes the vulnerable login code by implementing a parameterized SQL query.

Goals
This use case teaches students how insecure SQL queries can be exploited and how to apply a secure fix. 
It supports Codesafe’s goal of providing hands-on cybersecurity learning experiences.

Primary Actor
Student

Secondary Actors
Instructor, Researcher

Preconditions
- The student is logged into Codesafe.
- The SQL Injection challenge is available and loads successfully.
- The starter file (sql_injection_dojo.py) is accessible within the environment.

Postconditions
- The student successfully implements a secure login function.
- SQL injection attempts fail.
- All automated test cases pass.

Main Flow
1. The student selects the SQL Injection challenge from their Codesafe dashboard.
2. Codesafe loads the starter code, including:
   - a vulnerable login function,
   - a destructive SQL injection example,
   - an incomplete safe_login() function.
3. The student runs the vulnerable login and sees how SQL injection can let someone bypass the login or mess with the database.
4. The student edits safe_login() to use a parameterized SQL query instead of string formatting.
5. The student tests their updated code:
   - valid credentials work,
   - invalid credentials fail,
   - injection attempts no longer succeed.
6. The student submits their solution.
7. Codesafe automatically runs the unit tests to verify correctness.
8. If all tests pass, the challenge is marked complete.

Alternative Flows
A1 – The student uses incorrect SQL syntax and encounters an error.  
     The tests fail, and the student revises their code.

A2 – The student removes required output or logic.  
     The automated tests detect this, and the student makes corrections.

Exceptions
- Errors caused by using the SQL parameters incorrectly.
- Using unsafe functions (e.g., executescript()) results in test failure.

Rationale
This use case provides students with a practical exercise to understand SQL injection and implement secure coding practices in a realistic scenario, reinforcing Codesafe’s educational objectives.
